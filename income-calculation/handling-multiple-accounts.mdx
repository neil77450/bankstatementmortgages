Many self-employed borrowers have more than one bank account—separate business and personal accounts, multiple business accounts, or accounts at different banks. Lenders can work with multiple accounts, but the process requires care to avoid double-counting and ensure all legitimate income is captured.

## Combining Multiple Accounts

When you submit statements from multiple accounts, lenders add up eligible deposits across all of them. However, they must first identify and remove transfers between accounts so the same money isn't counted twice.

**Example:** You deposit \$10,000 from a client into your business account, then transfer \$6,000 to your personal account.

| Account | Deposit |
|---------|---------|
| Business | \$10,000 (client payment) |
| Personal | \$6,000 (transfer from business) |
| **Total deposits** | **\$16,000** |
| Less transfer | −\$6,000 |
| **Eligible deposits** | **\$10,000** |

Without removing the transfer, you'd appear to have \$16,000 in income when you actually have \$10,000.

## What Lenders Need

When submitting multiple accounts, provide:

- Complete statements for all accounts covering the same time period
- Clear labeling of which accounts are personal vs business
- Explanation of regular transfers between accounts

Consistency matters—if you're submitting 12 months of statements, all accounts need the full 12 months.

## When Multiple Accounts Help

Submitting multiple accounts makes sense when:

- You have legitimate income deposited across different accounts
- Different business entities each have their own accounts
- A single account doesn't capture your full income picture

## When to Keep It Simple

More accounts means more complexity and more opportunities for deposits to be questioned. If most of your income flows through one primary account, submitting just that account may result in faster, cleaner underwriting.

## Multiple Businesses

If you own multiple businesses, each with separate accounts, lenders can combine income from all of them. Each business typically needs to meet the self-employment history requirement (usually two years), and each set of business statements gets its own expense factor applied.
