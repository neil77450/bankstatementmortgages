description: "Choosing between 12 and 24 month bank statement programs based on your income history"
---

Bank statement lenders offer programs using either 12 or 24 months of statements. The choice affects your qualifying income since both programs average deposits over their respective periods.

## When 12-Month Programs Work Better

A shorter lookback period favors borrowers with rising income.

**Example:** A contractor earned \$8,000/month two years ago but now earns \$15,000/month.

| Program | Monthly Qualifying Income |
|---------|---------------------------|
| 12-month | \$15,000 |
| 24-month | \$11,500 |

**Choose 12 months if** your income has increased recently or you had a slow period more than a year ago.

## When 24-Month Programs Work Better

A longer lookback period smooths out fluctuations.

**Example:** A real estate agent earned \$25,000/month last year but only \$12,000/month this year due to a slow market.

| Program | Monthly Qualifying Income |
|---------|---------------------------|
| 12-month | \$12,000 |
| 24-month | \$18,500 |

**Choose 24 months if** your income decreased recently or you have seasonal fluctuations that even out over time.

## Other Considerations

- Not all lenders offer both options—some require 24 months for larger loans or lower credit scores
- 12-month programs may carry slightly higher rates
- 24 months means more statements to gather and more deposits to explain

If your lender offers both options, ask them to calculate qualifying income both ways. The difference can be substantial.
