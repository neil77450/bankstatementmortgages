title: "Deposits to Exclude"
description: "Understanding which deposits lenders exclude when calculating bank statement income"
---

Not every deposit in your bank statements counts toward qualifying income. Lenders review each deposit and exclude those that don't represent actual business or employment income. Understanding what gets excluded helps you prepare and avoid surprises.

## Common Excluded Deposits

**Transfers between your own accounts** — Moving money from savings to checking or from business to personal doesn't create new income. Lenders identify and exclude these.

**Loan proceeds** — Business loans, personal loans, lines of credit draws, and credit card cash advances are debt, not income.

**Gifts** — Money received as gifts, even if documented, typically can't be counted as recurring income.

**Tax refunds** — Federal and state refunds are one-time events, not ongoing income.

**Insurance proceeds** — Claim payments for property damage, accidents, or other insured events aren't business income.

**Legal settlements** — Lawsuit proceeds or insurance settlements are excluded.

**Asset sales** — Selling a vehicle, equipment, or property generates a one-time deposit, not recurring income.

**Reimbursements** — Expense reimbursements from clients or employers aren't profit.

**Cash deposits** — Large cash deposits raise red flags and are often excluded unless you can document their source.

## How Lenders Identify Exclusions

Lenders review your statements line by line, looking at:

- Deposit descriptions and memo fields
- Round-number deposits that suggest transfers
- Matching withdrawals and deposits across accounts
- Irregular large deposits outside your normal pattern

Any deposit that looks unusual will require explanation. The lender may ask for documentation proving the source.

## Preparing Your Statements

To minimize issues during underwriting:

- Avoid unnecessary transfers between accounts during the statement period
- Keep records documenting the source of any large or unusual deposits
- Be ready to explain deposits that don't match your typical income pattern
- If you receive a legitimate large payment (big client contract, annual bonus), have invoices or contracts available

## What Happens When Deposits Are Excluded

Excluded deposits reduce your total eligible deposits, which directly reduces your qualifying income. If \$50,000 of your \$300,000 in deposits gets excluded, you're qualifying on \$250,000 instead.

Review your statements before applying. If you see deposits that will likely be excluded, factor that into your expectations for qualifying income.
