When applying for a bank statement mortgage, you'll need to decide whether to submit personal bank statements, business bank statements, or both. Each approach has different calculation methods.

## Personal Bank Statements

Personal statements show deposits into your individual accounts. Lenders assume these represent money you've already paid yourself—income after business expenses.

- Lower or no expense factor applied (typically 0-10%)
- Simpler documentation and underwriting
- Only counts money that reaches your personal account

## Business Bank Statements

Business statements show revenue flowing through your company accounts. Lenders apply an expense factor to account for operating costs.

- Captures total business revenue
- Higher expense factors reduce qualifying income (30-50% typical)
- Requires more documentation (business license, formation docs)

## Combined Statements

Some lenders allow both personal and business statements together. Income from each is calculated separately then combined—capturing your full financial picture but adding underwriting complexity.

## Which Should You Choose?

**Personal statements** work best if you pay yourself regularly and most income flows to your personal account.

**Business statements** work best if you retain significant earnings in the business or your personal deposits don't reflect your true income.

**Combined statements** work best if your income is split between accounts and neither alone tells the full story.

## Example Comparison

A business owner deposits \$20,000/month into their business account and transfers \$10,000/month to personal.

| Approach | Monthly Qualifying Income |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Personal only | \$10,000 |
| Business only (50% expense factor) | \$10,000 |
| Combined | \$15,000 |

Ask prospective lenders to run the numbers both ways before deciding.S
