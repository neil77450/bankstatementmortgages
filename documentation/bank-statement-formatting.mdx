Lenders have specific requirements for how bank statements must be formatted and submitted. Providing statements correctly the first time avoids delays and back-and-forth during underwriting.

## Acceptable Statement Formats

**Preferred:** Statements downloaded directly from your bank's online portal as PDF files. These are considered "bank-generated" and carry the most credibility.

**Acceptable:** Paper statements scanned to PDF, as long as all pages are complete and legible.

**Not acceptable:** Screenshots, spreadsheets, or statements that appear altered or incomplete.

## Required Information

Each statement must clearly show:

- Bank name and logo
- Account holder name(s)
- Account number (full or partially masked)
- Statement period (start and end dates)
- Beginning and ending balances
- All transactions with dates and descriptions
- Page numbers (e.g., "Page 1 of 3")

## Complete and Consecutive

**Complete:** Every page of every statement must be included, even pages with disclosures or no transactions.

**Consecutive:** Statements must cover a continuous period with no gaps. For a 12-month program, you need 12 consecutive months with no missing months.

**Example:** For a 12-month program ending in March 2024, you need statements from April 2023 through March 2024—all 12 months, no gaps.

## Multiple Accounts

If submitting statements from multiple accounts:

- Provide complete statements for each account
- Cover the same time period for all accounts
- Label clearly which account is personal versus business

## Common Rejection Reasons

| Issue | How to Fix |
|-------|------------|
| Missing pages | Download full statement again |
| Statement period gaps | Obtain missing month from bank |
| Blurry or illegible scans | Re-scan at higher resolution |
| Cropped or cut-off information | Ensure full page is captured |
| Statements don't match application | Verify account holder name matches exactly |

## Tips for Clean Submission

- Download statements directly from online banking when possible
- Check that every page downloaded before submitting
- Verify the statement period covers the full month
- Name files clearly (e.g., "Chase_Business_Jan2024.pdf")
- Review for any missing or illegible transaction details

Taking time to prepare clean, complete statements upfront saves days or weeks during underwriting.
