Bank statement lenders require proof that your business exists and that you have ownership. This documentation verifies your self-employment status and confirms you're entitled to the income shown in your bank statements.

## Why Lenders Require This

Unlike W-2 employees whose employers can be verified with a phone call, self-employed borrowers must prove:

- The business is real and operating
- You own or have a stake in the business
- The business has been operating long enough (typically 2 years)

## Common Documentation Options

Lenders typically require one or more of the following:

**Business license** — A license issued by your city, county, or state authorizing you to operate. Must be current and show the business name and your name as owner.

**Articles of incorporation or organization** — Formation documents filed with the state when establishing a corporation or LLC. Shows ownership structure and formation date.

**Partnership agreement** — For partnerships, the agreement outlining ownership percentages and partner names.

**DBA registration** — "Doing Business As" or fictitious name registration if operating under a name different from your legal name.

**Professional license** — For licensed professionals (real estate agents, contractors, CPAs), your state-issued professional license may suffice.

## What Lenders Look For

| Element | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Your name | Confirms you're the owner |
| Business name | Matches bank statements |
| Formation/issue date | Proves length of self-employment |
| Current status | Business must be active, not dissolved |
| Ownership percentage | Confirms your stake in the business |

## Sole Proprietors

If you operate as a sole proprietor without a formal business entity, you may provide:

- Business license or DBA registration
- Professional license
- CPA letter confirming self-employment
- Two years of tax returns showing Schedule C (some lenders)

## Keeping Documents Current

Ensure your business license and registrations are not expired. Lenders will reject expired documentation. If renewal is due soon, renew before applying to avoid delays.
