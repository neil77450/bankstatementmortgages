CPA letters and profit/loss statements provide third-party validation of your business income and expenses. While not always required, these documents can improve your qualifying income by justifying a lower expense factor.

## CPA Letters

A CPA letter is a statement from your accountant confirming details about your business and income. Lenders use these to verify information that bank statements alone don't show.

**A CPA letter typically confirms:**

- You are self-employed in the stated business
- Length of time in business
- Your ownership percentage
- The business is currently operating
- Actual expense ratio (if requested)

**Sample language:** "I have prepared tax returns for [borrower name] for the past three years. They are the 100% owner of [business name], a consulting firm operating since 2019. Based on my review of their financials, their business expenses average 25% of gross revenue."

## How CPA Letters Reduce Expense Factors

Without documentation, lenders apply default expense factors based on industry—often 40-50%. A CPA letter stating your actual expenses are 25% can significantly increase qualifying income.

**Example on \$400,000 annual deposits:**

| Expense Factor | Qualifying Income |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 50% (default) | \$200,000 |
| 25% (CPA-verified) | \$300,000 |

That \$100,000 difference substantially increases borrowing power.

## Profit & Loss Statements

A profit and loss (P&L) statement summarizes your business revenue and expenses over a specific period. Lenders may request a P&L covering the same timeframe as your bank statements.

**P&L requirements vary by lender:**

- Some accept borrower-prepared P&Ls
- Others require CPA-prepared or CPA-reviewed P&Ls
- Some require the P&L to be audited

A CPA-prepared P&L carries more weight than a self-prepared one.

## What Lenders Look For

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Gross revenue | Should align with bank statement deposits |
| Itemized expenses | Justifies expense factor |
| Net profit | Supports qualifying income calculation |
| Preparation date | Must be recent |
| CPA signature/letterhead | Adds credibility |

## When to Get a CPA Letter

Consider obtaining a CPA letter if:

- Your actual expenses are lower than industry defaults
- You want to maximize qualifying income
- The lender offers a reduced expense factor with documentation
- Your business type typically triggers high default expense factors

The cost of a CPA letter (typically \$100-300) can be worth thousands in additional borrowing capacity.
