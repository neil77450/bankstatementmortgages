Bank statement mortgages often accommodate larger loan amounts than conventional financing, making them popular for jumbo and super jumbo purchases. However, both minimums and maximums apply, and terms vary based on loan size.

## Typical Loan Amount Ranges

| Loan Size | Typical Range |
|-----------|---------------|
| Minimum | \$100,000 - \$150,000 |
| Standard maximum | \$2 - \$3 million |
| Extended maximum | \$5 - \$10 million+ |

Some lenders specialize in higher loan amounts while others focus on loans under \$1 million. Not every lender offers the full range.

## How Loan Amount Affects Terms

Larger loans typically come with stricter requirements:

| Loan Amount | Typical Max LTV | Reserve Requirements |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Under \$1M | 90% | 6-12 months |
| \$1M - \$1.5M | 85% | 12 months |
| \$1.5M - \$2M | 80% | 12-18 months |
| \$2M - \$3M | 75% | 18-24 months |
| Over \$3M | 70% | 24+ months |

Higher credit scores may unlock better LTV at larger loan amounts.

## Jumbo Bank Statement Loans

Loans exceeding conventional conforming limits (\$766,550 in most areas for 2024) are considered jumbo. Bank statement jumbo loans are common because:

- High earners are often self-employed
- Tax optimization strategies reduce documented income
- Conventional jumbo underwriting is strict on income documentation

## Super Jumbo Loans

Loans over \$2-3 million enter super jumbo territory. These require:

- Significant assets and reserves
- Higher down payments (25-30%+)
- Strong credit (often 720+)
- Established relationship with specialized lenders

Fewer lenders operate in this space, but options exist for qualified borrowers.

## Minimum Loan Amounts

Most bank statement lenders set minimums between \$100,000 and \$150,000. Below this threshold, the manual underwriting process isn't cost-effective for lenders. For smaller loans, conventional or FHA financing may be better options if you qualify.
