Bank statement mortgage rates aren't one-size-fits-all. Lenders start with a base rate and apply adjustments based on your specific risk profile. Understanding these factors helps you anticipate your rate and identify ways to improve it.

## How Pricing Works

Lenders begin with a base rate for their bank statement program, then add or subtract adjustments for various risk factors. These adjustments are typically expressed in percentage points or basis points (0.01%).

**Example rate build-up:**

| Factor | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Base rate | 7.00% |
| Credit score (680) | +0.50% |
| LTV (85%) | +0.25% |
| Investment property | +0.50% |
| Loan amount (\$1.2M) | +0.25% |
| **Final rate** | **8.50%** |

## Common Pricing Adjustments

**Credit score:**

| Score Range | Typical Adjustment |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 760+ | -0.25% to 0% |
| 720-759 | 0% |
| 700-719 | +0.25% |
| 680-699 | +0.50% |
| 660-679 | +0.75% to +1.00% |
| 620-659 | +1.00% to +1.50% |

**Loan-to-value:**

| LTV | Typical Adjustment |
|-----|-------------------|
| 70% or below | -0.25% |
| 75% | 0% |
| 80% | +0.125% |
| 85% | +0.25% |
| 90% | +0.50% |

**Occupancy type:**

| Type | Typical Adjustment |
|------|-------------------|
| Primary residence | 0% |
| Second home | +0.25% |
| Investment property | +0.50% to +0.75% |

**Loan amount:**

| Amount | Typical Adjustment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Under \$1M | 0% |
| \$1M - \$1.5M | +0.125% to +0.25% |
| \$1.5M - \$2M | +0.25% to +0.50% |
| Over \$2M | +0.50%+ |

## Other Factors That Affect Pricing

- **Property type** — Non-warrantable condos, 2-4 units, and mixed-use may add 0.25-0.50%
- **Interest-only** — Typically adds 0.25-0.50%
- **Cash-out refinance** — Adds 0.25-0.50% versus purchase or rate/term refinance
- **Self-employed tenure** — Less than 2 years may add to rate or limit availability

## Improving Your Rate

Factors you can control before applying:

- Increase credit score by paying down balances
- Make a larger down payment to reduce LTV
- Pay discount points to buy down the rate (typically 1 point = 0.25% rate reduction)

Factors to shop for:

- Compare base rates across lenders
- Find lenders with favorable adjustments for your profile
- Look for promotional pricing or relationship discounts
