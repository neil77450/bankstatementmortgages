Bank statement mortgages and traditional mortgages serve the same purpose but differ in how income is verified, who they're designed for, and what they cost.

## Income Documentation

The fundamental difference is how you prove your income.

**Traditional mortgages** require W-2 forms, tax returns, pay stubs, and employer verification.

**Bank statement mortgages** require 12-24 months of consecutive bank statements and proof of self-employment. No tax returns in most cases.

For W-2 employees, traditional documentation is simple. For self-employed borrowers whose tax returns understate their actual income, bank statements tell a more accurate story.

## Key Differences

| Factor | Traditional | Bank Statement |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Best for | W-2 employees | Self-employed borrowers |
| Interest rates | Lower | Higher (+0.5-2%) |
| Down payment | 3-20% | 10-25% |
| Credit score minimum | 580-620 | 620-700 |
| Mortgage insurance | Required if less than 20% down | Typically not required |
| Closing timeline | 21-30 days | 30-45 days |
| Loan limits | Conforming limits apply | Up to \$5 million+ |

## Rate and Cost Impact

On a \$500,000 loan, a 1% rate difference translates to roughly \$300 more per month. Over 30 years, that adds up to significant additional interest. However, if bank statement documentation allows you to qualify for a home you otherwise couldn't purchase, the rate premium may be worthwhile.

## Which Should You Choose?

**Choose a traditional mortgage if** you're a W-2 employee and your tax returns accurately reflect your income. It will almost always be the better financial choice.

**Choose a bank statement mortgage if** you're self-employed, your tax returns understate your income, and you have 10%+ for a down payment with strong credit.

Bank statement loans exist to fill the gap for borrowers who can't use traditional documentation, not as an alternative for those who can.
