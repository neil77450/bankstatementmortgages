Bank statement mortgages are designed for borrowers who have strong income but can't document it through traditional tax returns. The primary qualifying factor is self-employment, but the specifics of who qualifies—and how—vary by lender.

## Self-Employed Borrowers

The core requirement for a bank statement mortgage is self-employment. Most lenders require you to have been self-employed for at least two years, though some will accept one year with compensating factors like a higher credit score or larger down payment.

Self-employment can take many forms:

- Sole proprietors
- LLC members
- S-corp or C-corp shareholders
- Partners in a partnership
- Freelancers and consultants

Lenders verify self-employment through business licenses, CPA letters, or business formation documents. Simply saying you're self-employed isn't enough—you need documentation proving your business exists and has been operating.

## 1099 Contractors

Independent contractors who receive 1099 income rather than W-2 wages are strong candidates for bank statement loans. This includes:

- Real estate agents and brokers
- Insurance agents
- Rideshare and delivery drivers
- Sales professionals on commission
- IT consultants and developers
- Healthcare professionals (traveling nurses, locum tenens physicians)
- Creative professionals (photographers, designers, writers)

Some lenders offer specific 1099 programs that may use a combination of 1099 forms and bank statements, potentially with more favorable terms than a pure bank statement program.

## Business Owners

Business owners who take distributions, pay themselves irregularly, or reinvest profits into their companies often benefit most from bank statement mortgages. Your business bank statements show the true revenue flowing through the company, which typically exceeds what shows up on your personal tax return.

Lenders may allow you to qualify using:

- **Personal bank statements only** — deposits into your personal accounts
- **Business bank statements only** — revenue flowing through your business accounts
- **Combined personal and business statements** — totaling deposits across both

The option you choose affects how income is calculated, particularly regarding expense factors.

## Minimum Requirements

While specific requirements vary by lender, most bank statement programs require:

| Requirement | Typical Range |
|-------------|---------------|
| Self-employment history | 1-2 years minimum |
| Credit score | 620-700 minimum |
| Down payment | 10-25% minimum |
| Debt-to-income ratio | Up to 50% |
| Reserves | 6-12 months PITIA |
| Loan amounts | \$100,000 to \$5 million+ |

## Who Does NOT Qualify

Bank statement mortgages aren't for everyone. You likely won't qualify if:

- **You're a W-2 employee** — Traditional documentation is required; use a conventional loan instead
- **You're newly self-employed** — Less than one year in business is typically a disqualifier
- **Your income is primarily cash** — Deposits must be traceable through bank statements
- **You have recent major credit events** — Bankruptcy, foreclosure, or short sale within the past 2-4 years
- **Your business is in a prohibited industry** — Cannabis, gambling, and certain other industries are excluded by most lenders

## Mixed Income Situations

Some borrowers have both W-2 income and self-employment income. Depending on the lender, you may be able to:

- Use only your self-employment income via bank statements
- Combine W-2 income (documented traditionally) with bank statement income
- Choose whichever documentation method results in higher qualifying income

This flexibility makes bank statement programs useful even for borrowers who aren't fully self-employed.

## Next Steps

If you meet the basic eligibility criteria, the next question is how much income you can qualify with. That depends on how your deposits are calculated and what expense factor is applied.
