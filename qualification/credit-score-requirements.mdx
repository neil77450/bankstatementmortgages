Credit score requirements for bank statement mortgages are generally higher than conventional loans. Because these loans carry more risk for lenders, your credit score significantly impacts approval odds, interest rates, and available terms.

## Minimum Score Requirements

Most bank statement lenders require a minimum credit score between 620 and 700, depending on the program:

| Credit Score | Typical Availability |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 720+ | Best rates and terms, lowest down payments |
| 700-719 | Competitive rates, standard terms |
| 680-699 | Moderate rate adjustments |
| 660-679 | Higher rates, may require larger down payment |
| 620-659 | Limited lenders, significant rate premium |
| Below 620 | Few options available |

Some lenders advertise minimums as low as 600, but expect substantial tradeoffs in rate and terms.

## How Credit Score Affects Pricing

Bank statement lenders use rate adjustments based on credit tiers. A borrower with a 740 score might pay 0.5% to 1.5% less than someone with a 660 score on the same loan.

**Example impact on a \$500,000 loan:**

| Credit Score | Approximate Rate | Monthly Payment |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 740 | 7.00% | \$3,327 |
| 700 | 7.50% | \$3,496 |
| 660 | 8.25% | \$3,752 |

Over 30 years, the difference between 740 and 660 scores costs over \$150,000 in additional interest.

## Credit Score and Down Payment

Lower credit scores often trigger higher down payment requirements:

| Credit Score | Typical Minimum Down Payment |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| 720+ | 10% |
| 680-719 | 15% |
| 660-679 | 20% |
| Below 660 | 25%+ |

A strong down payment can sometimes offset a lower credit score.

## Which Score Do Lenders Use?

Lenders pull credit from all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) and typically use the middle score. If you're applying with a co-borrower, they use the lower of the two middle scores.

## Improving Your Position

If your credit score is borderline, consider:

- Paying down credit card balances to reduce utilization
- Correcting any errors on your credit report
- Waiting to apply until a negative item ages off
- Increasing your down payment to offset the lower score

A few points can make the difference between approval and denial, or save thousands in interest over the loan term.
