Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) measures your monthly debt payments against your monthly income. It's a key factor in determining how much you can borrow with a bank statement mortgage.

## How DTI Is Calculated

**DTI = Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross Monthly Income**

For bank statement loans, your gross monthly income comes from the bank statement calculation—not tax returns or pay stubs.

**Example:** Your bank statements produce \$15,000/month qualifying income. Your monthly debts total \$6,000.

\$6,000 ÷ \$15,000 = 40% DTI

## What Counts as Debt

Lenders include these monthly obligations:

- Proposed mortgage payment (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, HOA)
- Car loans and leases
- Student loans
- Credit card minimum payments
- Personal loans
- Other mortgages or HELOCs
- Alimony or child support payments

They don't typically count utilities, cell phone bills, insurance premiums (other than homeowners), or subscriptions.

## DTI Limits for Bank Statement Loans

| DTI Range | Availability |
|-----------|--------------|
| Up to 43% | Most lenders, best terms |
| 43-50% | Many lenders with compensating factors |
| 50-55% | Limited lenders, requires strong file |
| Above 55% | Rare, requires significant compensating factors |

Maximum DTI varies by lender, credit score, LTV, and loan amount. A borrower with 750 credit and 30% down may qualify at 50% DTI, while someone with 660 credit and 10% down might be capped at 43%.

## Compensating Factors

Lenders may allow higher DTI if you have:

- Higher credit score (720+)
- Lower LTV / larger down payment
- Significant cash reserves (12+ months)
- Strong income trending upward
- History of managing similar payment amounts

## Lowering Your DTI

To improve your DTI before applying:

- Pay off smaller debts (car loans, credit cards)
- Avoid taking on new debt
- Increase qualifying income by choosing optimal statement period or expense factor
- Consider a less expensive property

A few percentage points of DTI can mean the difference between approval and denial, or unlock better loan terms.
