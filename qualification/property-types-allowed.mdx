Bank statement mortgages offer flexibility in property types, often financing properties that conventional lenders won't. However, not all properties qualify, and some come with additional requirements.

## Eligible Property Types

**Single-family residences** — The most straightforward property type. Detached homes, townhomes, and PUDs (planned unit developments) typically qualify without issue.

**Condominiums** — Warrantable condos qualify with most lenders. Non-warrantable condos (those that don't meet Fannie Mae guidelines) are also eligible with many bank statement lenders—a key advantage over conventional financing.

**2-4 unit properties** — Duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes qualify, whether owner-occupied or investment. Rental income from other units may help with qualification.

**Rural properties** — Homes on acreage typically qualify, though very large parcels (40+ acres) may face restrictions or require additional review.

## Property Types with Restrictions

| Property Type | Typical Availability |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Single-family | Widely available |
| Condo (warrantable) | Widely available |
| Condo (non-warrantable) | Many lenders |
| 2-4 units | Many lenders |
| Rural / acreage | Many lenders, size limits may apply |
| Mixed-use | Limited lenders |
| Manufactured homes | Limited lenders |
| Condotels | Limited lenders |
| Co-ops | Rare |

## Non-Warrantable Condos

Conventional lenders avoid non-warrantable condos, but many bank statement lenders accept them. A condo may be non-warrantable due to:

- Single entity owning too many units
- High investor concentration
- Pending litigation against the HOA
- Insufficient reserves
- Commercial space exceeding limits

Expect slightly higher rates or down payment requirements for non-warrantable condos.

## Mixed-Use Properties

Properties with both residential and commercial space (like a storefront with apartment above) qualify with some bank statement lenders. Typical requirements:

- Residential space must be primary use
- Commercial portion limited to 25-40% of total square footage
- Borrower may need to occupy residential portion

## Ineligible Properties

Most bank statement lenders won't finance:

- Vacant land
- Commercial-only properties
- Properties in disrepair
- Log homes or dome homes (with some exceptions)
- Houseboats or floating homes

When in doubt, ask your lender early—property eligibility issues discovered late in the process cause costly delays.
