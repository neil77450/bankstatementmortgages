Bank statement mortgages require larger down payments than conventional loans. Lenders offset the risk of non-QM lending by requiring more borrower equity upfront.

## Loan-to-Value Explained

Loan-to-value (LTV) is the ratio of your loan amount to the property value. If you're buying a \$500,000 home with a \$100,000 down payment, you're borrowing \$400,000—an 80% LTV.

**LTV = Loan Amount ÷ Property Value**

Lower LTV means more equity and less risk for the lender, which translates to better rates and terms for you.

## Typical LTV Limits

| Property Type | Maximum LTV | Minimum Down Payment |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Primary residence | 90% | 10% |
| Second home | 85% | 15% |
| Investment property | 80% | 20% |

These are common guidelines—some lenders go higher, others are more conservative. Higher loan amounts and lower credit scores typically reduce maximum LTV.

## How LTV Affects Pricing

Lower LTV generally means lower rates. Lenders apply pricing adjustments at various LTV thresholds:

| LTV | Rate Impact |
|-----|-------------|
| 70% or below | Best pricing |
| 75% | Slight adjustment |
| 80% | Standard pricing |
| 85% | Moderate adjustment |
| 90% | Highest adjustment |

Putting down 25% instead of 10% might save 0.25% to 0.75% on your rate.

## LTV and Loan Amount

Maximum LTV often decreases as loan amount increases:

| Loan Amount | Typical Max LTV |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Up to \$1 million | 90% |
| \$1-2 million | 85% |
| \$2-3 million | 80% |
| \$3 million+ | 70-75% |

Jumbo bank statement loans require more skin in the game.

## Refinance LTV Limits

For refinances, maximum LTV depends on the transaction type:

| Refinance Type | Typical Max LTV |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Rate and term | 85-90% |
| Cash-out | 75-80% |

Cash-out refinances have lower limits because you're extracting equity rather than just improving terms.

## Maximizing Your Options

If you're short on down payment:

- Some lenders accept gift funds for a portion of the down payment
- A few programs allow seller concessions toward closing costs
- Consider a lower purchase price to hit your target LTV
- Higher credit scores sometimes unlock higher LTV programs

More equity always improves your options—better rates, more lender choices, and easier approval.
