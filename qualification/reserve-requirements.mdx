---

Reserves are liquid assets you have remaining after closing. Lenders require reserves as a safety net—proof you can make mortgage payments even if income disruptions occur. Bank statement loans typically require more reserves than conventional mortgages.

## How Reserves Are Measured

Reserves are expressed in months of PITIA—your total monthly housing payment including:

- **P**rincipal
- **I**nterest
- **T**axes
- **I**nsurance
- **A**ssociation dues (HOA)

If your PITIA is \$4,000 and you have \$24,000 in eligible assets after closing, you have 6 months of reserves.

## Typical Reserve Requirements

| Scenario | Typical Reserves Required |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Primary residence | 6-12 months |
| Second home | 6-12 months |
| Investment property | 6-12 months |
| Loan amount over \$1M | 12-18 months |
| Loan amount over \$2M | 18-24 months |
| Multiple financed properties | Additional reserves per property |

Lower credit scores or higher LTV may increase reserve requirements.

## What Counts as Reserves

**Fully eligible (100%):**
- Checking and savings accounts
- Money market accounts
- Certificates of deposit

**Partially eligible (typically 60-70%):**
- Retirement accounts (401k, IRA)
- Stocks and bonds
- Mutual funds

**Not typically eligible:**
- Business operating accounts (needed for operations)
- Cryptocurrency (with most lenders)
- Unvested stock options
- Cash value life insurance (varies by lender)

## Documenting Reserves

Lenders verify reserves through:

- Bank statements (most recent 2 months)
- Investment account statements
- Retirement account statements

Large recent deposits will require sourcing and explanation, just like with your income documentation.

## Reserves vs Down Payment

Reserve requirements are separate from your down payment. If you have \$200,000 in savings and need \$100,000 for down payment and closing costs, your reserves are what remains—\$100,000.

Make sure you have enough for both before applying.
