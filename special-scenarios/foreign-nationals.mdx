Foreign nationals—non-US citizens without permanent residency—can qualify for bank statement mortgages with certain lenders. These programs allow international buyers to purchase US real estate without a Social Security number or US credit history.

## Who Qualifies

For mortgage purposes, a foreign national is someone who is not a US citizen and does not hold a green card or valid work visa. Visa holders and green card holders typically qualify under standard bank statement programs instead.

## Typical Requirements

| Requirement | Common Guidelines |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Down payment | 25-30% minimum |
| Maximum LTV | 65-75% |
| Reserves | 12-24 months PITIA |
| Loan amounts | \$100,000 to \$3-5 million |

Requirements are stricter than standard bank statement loans due to additional risk factors.

## Documentation

- Valid passport from country of origin
- Foreign tax ID number
- 12-24 months of bank statements (foreign or US accounts)
- International credit report or alternative credit references
- Employment or business verification

## Additional Considerations

**Higher rates** — Expect rates 0.5-1.5% higher than standard bank statement programs.

**Property types** — Most programs allow second homes and investment properties. Primary residence options are less common.

**US bank account** — Required for mortgage payments, must be established before closing.

**FIRPTA** — Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act requires withholding on future property sales. Consult an international tax advisor before purchasing.
