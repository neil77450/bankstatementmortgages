Most bank statement programs require two years of self-employment history. However, options exist for borrowers who recently started their business or transitioned from W-2 employment.

## The Two-Year Standard

Lenders prefer two years because it demonstrates:

- Business stability and viability
- Consistent income patterns
- Ability to weather seasonal fluctuations

Without this track record, lenders view the loan as higher risk.

## Options for Newer Businesses

**One-year programs** — Some lenders offer 12-month self-employment requirements with compensating factors:

| Compensating Factor | How It Helps |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Higher credit score (720+) | Demonstrates financial responsibility |
| Larger down payment (25%+) | More borrower equity at risk |
| Substantial reserves (12+ months) | Proof of financial cushion |
| Same industry experience | Shows expertise despite new business |

**Related work history** — If you were a W-2 employee in the same field before starting your business, some lenders count this toward the two-year requirement. An accountant who worked at a firm for five years then started their own practice may qualify immediately.

## Documentation for Newer Businesses

Expect more scrutiny with less than two years:

- Full 12 months of bank statements
- Business formation documents with exact start date
- Business license showing issue date
- CPA letter confirming business operations
- Evidence of prior industry experience (resume, LinkedIn, former W-2s)

## When to Wait

If you're close to the two-year mark, waiting may be worthwhile:

- More lender options available
- Better rates and terms
- Easier approval process
- Less compensating factors required

Six months of patience could save thousands in rate premium.

## Alternative Approaches

If bank statement programs won't work:

- **Asset depletion** — Qualify using liquid assets instead of income
- **Co-borrower** — Add a qualifying W-2 borrower to the application
- **Non-QM DSCR loans** — For investment properties, qualify based on property cash flow rather than personal income
