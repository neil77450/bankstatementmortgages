Many self-employed borrowers own multiple businesses. Bank statement lenders can work with this complexity, combining income across entities to maximize qualifying income.

## How Multiple Businesses Are Handled

Lenders evaluate each business separately, then combine the results:

1. Verify each business meets self-employment requirements (typically 2 years)
2. Collect bank statements for each business account
3. Apply appropriate expense factors to each business
4. Sum the qualifying income from all sources

## Example Calculation

| Business | Expense Factor | Annual Deposits | Qualifying Income |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Consulting LLC | 25% | \$200,000 | \$150,000 |
| Retail store | 50% | \$300,000 | \$150,000 |
| **Combined** | | | **\$300,000** |

## Documentation for Each Business

- 12 or 24 months of bank statements
- Business license or formation documents
- Proof of ownership percentage
- CPA letter (optional, but helpful)

## Key Considerations

**Ownership percentage** — Partial owners may only receive credit for their share of income. A 50% owner gets 50% of qualifying income.

**Intercompany transfers** — Money moving between your businesses gets flagged and excluded. Keep clean records distinguishing revenue from transfers.

**Business tenure** — If one business is newer than two years, that income may not count even if your other businesses qualify.

**More paperwork** — Multiple entities means multiplied documentation. Get all businesses properly documented before applying.
