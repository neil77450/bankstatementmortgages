Bank statement mortgages are popular for investment property financing. Self-employed investors often have complex tax situations that make traditional documentation difficult, and bank statement programs offer more flexibility than conventional investment property loans.

## Why Investors Choose Bank Statement Loans

- Tax returns often show losses due to depreciation and write-offs
- Conventional investment property guidelines are restrictive
- Higher loan amounts available than conventional limits
- Can finance multiple properties without hitting conventional caps

## Typical Investment Property Requirements

| Requirement | Common Guidelines |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Down payment | 20-25% minimum |
| Maximum LTV | 75-80% |
| Credit score | 680+ (some lenders allow 660) |
| Reserves | 6-12 months per property |
| DTI | Up to 50% |

Investment properties have stricter requirements than primary residences due to higher default risk.

## Using Rental Income to Qualify

Some bank statement lenders allow rental income to supplement your qualifying income:

**Subject property rental income** — Projected rent from the property you're purchasing, typically supported by an appraisal with rental analysis or existing lease.

**Other rental income** — Income from investment properties you already own, documented through leases and bank statement deposits.

Lenders may use 75% of gross rent to account for vacancy and expenses.

## Property Types

Most bank statement lenders finance:

- Single-family rentals
- 2-4 unit properties
- Condos (including non-warrantable)
- Short-term rentals (Airbnb/VRBO) with some lenders

## Rate and Pricing Impact

Investment properties carry pricing adjustments:

| Factor | Typical Adjustment |
|--------|-------------------|
| Investment property occupancy | +0.50% to +0.75% |
| 2-4 units | +0.25% additional |
| Cash-out refinance | +0.25% to +0.50% |

A single-family investment purchase might be 0.5% higher than an equivalent primary residence loan. A 4-unit cash-out refinance could be 1%+ higher.

## Multiple Investment Properties

If you own multiple financed properties, lenders typically require additional reserves for each—often 2-6 months PITIA per property beyond the subject property. This can add up quickly for portfolio investors.
